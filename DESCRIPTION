Description: This work is a part of the Scilab Toolbox Hackathon organised by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.Autonomous systems are being developed at a very large scale nowadays. Companies are investing billions. Almost all of them process point clouds. Hence it is necessary that scilab has tools which can be  used to process these point clouds.
